Hi, I'm Max, a developer with a very wide specialization. Over the last 8 years in development I've been almost everywhere, from frontend to infrastructure, from backend to embedded. For a full list of buzzwords and technologies, please see [CV page](/en/cv).

*Widestack*? Well, my specialization is pretty far away from the casual web Fullstack (infrastructure, mobile, system things, embedded) so it doesn't fit anymore. Usually, normal people just use the proud word "engineer" for such cases, but, IMHO, it's a bit early. As soon as I make something really *engineering*, I'll call myself an engineer. For now, let it be Widestack, it sounds quite *cool*.
